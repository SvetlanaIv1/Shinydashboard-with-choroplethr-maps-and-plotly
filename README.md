# Shinydashboard-with-choroplethr-maps-and-plotly
A HDiploma project for data localisation.  Shinydashboard with plotly and country_choropleth maps.

Code in R is only a part of the project. The project goal was to compare a shinydashboard with another one. I choose PowerBI as second tool.
Data is merged from different sources, but mostly from gapminder.org.
Dashboard has 8 pages and it is created to try all plots that were used in my previous project https://github.com/SvetlanaIv1/Visualisation-with-Plotly-in-R
